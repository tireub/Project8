This project is realised as part of the Python Applications Developper cursus
at Openclassrooms.

The point of the project is to answer a request from a client about the
development of a merchant website that focuses on providing replacements for
day-to-day consumed products. The point is to get similar products with a
better nutritionnal value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project has been developped using the Django framework. Codename for the project
is nutella_project.


The structure for this project is pretty standard for a django project.


The nutella_project subfolder contains the root files allowing the app to
properly work (init, settings, root urls and wsgi). It's to be noted that the
version hosted here is te development version. For production the settings are
quite different, as one can assume.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main part of the app is stored in the catalog subfolder.
Appart form the usual files that can be found in any django project, there is
a python file named apiload, which has been used to fill the database with data
from the openfoodfacts API. Currently these functions are not used by the app
but should be in the future with the implementation of regular update of the
database.
functions.py contains the main research algorithm which tries to find the
closest match in the database for a request and then offers substitution
products depending on the above product categories.
forms.py is used for the user registration.

Views names are as self-explanatory as posible. The fill_db function is not used
anymore but can be modified in the future for the update feature.

Models contains the requested elements regarding the database of products.
It also contains a stores element as the client mentionned that it would be
used in the next version of the website.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The database is supported by MySQL.
Approximately 1/4 of the Openfoodfacts database has been imported within our
database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Templates names are self-explanatory and can be easily linked to the appropriate
view.

They have been separated in two distinct parts, one for the catalog pages in
general and one for the registration and user management.

THINGS TO IMPROVE:

- Some parts of the front could be improved (footer, some responsive features).
- For the search algorithm, one could find already existing research algorithms
to apply that would be less sensitive to spelling mistakes or could use some
relevance factor to better match the item requested on which to get the
substitution results.
- Import from the API could be improved, as the OFF database is quite big and
not always really clear.
